Final coursework of Programming Foundation for Medical Image Analysis.

Spatial data augmentation using a Gaussian spline 
Three main classes are implemented, for 3D images, Gaussian spline (GS) and free-form deformation (FFD) based on GS, with a number of algorithms. Together, these algorithms form the basis of a useful application in medical image analysis applications, spatial data augmentation. Most frequently, the FFD is implemented with B-Splines. For the purpose of this coursework, the Gaussian spline is used, which was originally proposed in 1994.
